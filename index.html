    <h2>Why they chose different paths on the peak of their career?</h2>
    <p>
      One Direction, British-Irish male vocal group whose stylish good looks and
      bright pop-rock sound helped make it one of the best-selling boy bands of
      all time. One Direction released five hit albums, including Up All Night
      (2011) and Midnight Memories (2013), before going on an indefinite hiatus
      in 2016.

    <h3 class="formation">Formation</h3>
    <p>
      The group formed in 2010 on the British television show The X Factor, a
      talent contest for aspiring singers. Each of the five members auditioned
      and originally competed as a solo performer, but early in the season they
      were advised to pool their talents. Taking the name One Direction, the
      boys—all were between 16 and 18 years old at the time—attracted
      substantial attention, especially from young female viewers, for their
      charismatic stage presence and vocal skills. Although One Direction
      ultimately fell short of winning on The X Factor, the show’s mastermind,
      Simon Cowell, offered the act a recording contract soon after the season
      ended.
